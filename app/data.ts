Additional technical functionality was explored for self-interest and to document learning agility.\n\n2.) To align more with the position's responsibilities, I built out a couple examples: The first to demonstrate different methods, processes, frameworks, and systems with a scneario of when to pivot and why. The second to demonstrate a scenario of when to scale back on features even an initial prototype - and that project is left incomplete strictly for display purposes.\n\n3.) For anyone at Anthropic who may come across this, I of course still welcome an opportunity should one be available. I am not abandoning this demonstration project in as much as I will be completing more in-depth research and customer development that eiher won't require the near daily updates or to respect anonomity of the organizations I will be speaking to.
