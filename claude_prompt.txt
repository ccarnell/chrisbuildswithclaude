I need to implement an expand/collapse feature for the "Learning Snapshots" section on my website's homepage. The feature should:

1. On initial page load, only display Backlog, WIP, and the latest Update
2. Add an "+++ expand +++" text link below these items
3. When clicked, expand to show all updates without jumping the page view
4. Add a "--- collapse ---" text link at the bottom when expanded
5. When collapsed, return to showing only Backlog, WIP, and latest Update

The Learning Snapshots section is currently in my page.tsx file around line 206, where I have an h3 heading "Learning Snapshots" followed by mapping through the SNAPSHOT array from my data.ts file.

Important context:
- I'm using Next.js 15 with Tailwind CSS
- I'm using motion-primitives for animations (motion.section, motion.main, etc.)
- My SNAPSHOT data in data.ts has items with titles starting with "Backlog", "WIP", and "Update"
- Keep any existing conditional title styling intact
- Preserve the existing Spotlight component and styling for each item
- Keep the same card styling for each snapshot item

Please implement this feature by:
1. Adding a useState hook to track expanded state
2. Filtering the SNAPSHOT array to show only required items when collapsed
3. Adding the expand/collapse buttons with simple styling
4. Ensuring the implementation works with my existing animation components
5. Preserving all existing styling for the snapshot items

I want the simplest implementation that meets these requirements without breaking any existing functionality.
