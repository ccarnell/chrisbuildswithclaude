/*
COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT UPDATE: AI SAFETY PIVOT TO ECONOMIC INDEX

I need help implementing several updates to my web application to showcase a strategic product pivot from AI Safety & Ethics to an Anthropic Economic Index Geographic Tool. This involves:

1. Adding a Strategic Pivot section to the existing AI Safety & Ethics page
2. Creating a new Economic Index Product page
3. Implementing visualizations including a 2x2 decision matrix
4. Updating navigation and structure to reflect this pivot

My site uses Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

PART 1: ADD STRATEGIC PIVOT SECTION TO AI SAFETY PAGE
-----------------------------------------------------
Add a prominent section at the top of the AI Safety & Ethics page that explains the strategic pivot.

Location: At the top of the AI Safety page content, before existing content.

Content:
- Header: "Strategic Pivot: From AI Safety Framework to Economic Index Impact Tool"
- Explanation of the pivot rationale
- 2x2 Decision matrix visualization
- "What's Preserved" section explaining how this work relates to the new direction
- Call-to-action button linking to the new Economic Index page

PART 2: CREATE ECONOMIC INDEX PRODUCT PAGE
------------------------------------------
Create a new page following similar structure to the AI Safety page but focused on the Economic Index project.

Requirements:
- URL path: /economic-index
- Similar navigation/header/footer to other pages
- Include Project Timeline component with new milestones
- Create Strategic Dashboard section at the top
- Include product vision, decision framework, and concept sections

PART 3: CREATE VISUALIZATIONS
-----------------------------
Implement the following visualizations:

1. Product Evolution Decision Matrix (2x2 grid)
   - X-axis: "Alignment with Anthropic Research" (Low to High)
   - Y-axis: "Leverages My Expertise" (Low to High)
   - 4 options in quadrants (as detailed below)
   - Highlight selected approach in upper right

2. Product Development Timeline
   - Similar to existing Timeline component
   - Show 4 milestones with dates
   - Allow expansion to show tasks

3. Simple Dashboard Wireframe 
   - Mockup of the geographic visualization tool
   - Doesn't need to be functional, just visually representative

PART 4: NAVIGATION & STRUCTURE UPDATES
--------------------------------------
Update navigation to:
- Keep AI Safety page accessible
- Add prominent link to new Economic Index page
- Update homepage to reference the strategic pivot

DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS
----------------------
Below are detailed specifications for each component:

    "1. Building on Anthropic's existing research rather than creating a parallel framework",
    "2. Creating a tool with dual value: public economic visualization and internal sales targeting",
    "3. Leveraging my economic development expertise more effectively"
  ],

// IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
// -------------------
// Please help with the following implementation tasks:

/*
1. Create a DecisionMatrix component that renders the 2x2 matrix visualization
   - Should take the decisionMatrixData as props
   - Match the dark theme of the site
   - Highlight the selected option with our blue color

2. Create a StrategicPivotSection component for the AI Safety page
   - Include the Decision Matrix
   - Format the rationale points as a bulleted list
   - Include a prominent CTA button linking to the new page

3. Create the new EconomicIndex page
   - Follow the same structure as the AI Safety page
   - Implement the Timeline component with the new milestones
   - Include the Decision Matrix
   - Add a simple wireframe mockup of the geographic dashboard

4. Update navigation to include the new page
   - Add link in appropriate places
   - Keep existing structure intact

5. Give special attention to making everything mobile-responsive
   - Decision matrix should be especially careful on small screens

Please generate the necessary TypeScript/React components, and provide instructions on where each file should be placed in the project structure.
