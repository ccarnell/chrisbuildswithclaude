#Step 1
claude-code, to get context, please review my the CLAUDE.md file, my components, and the tsx files titled 'data', 'layout', and 'page'.

#Step 2
claude-code, i would like to implement a very simple PDF viewer with minimal features:
1. The pdf's are currently in the /public folder.
2. I would like to utilize the same design as the SocialLink buttons in the data.tsx file as what is used to click to display the pdf's.
3. I will defer to you if the PDF should just expand or if it should open a new tab. Either way, it should allow page navigation and the pathway should be seamless to exit out of the pdf.

#Step 3
claude-code, please ensure we create everything needed to work flawlessly:
1. Any necessary compenents if needed.
2. CSS updates if necessary.
3. Instructions for installing any dependencies.

#Step 4
claude-code, for context, my pdf's are small and have these characteristics:
1. The largest PDF is only 2 MB
2. At most they will be 2 pages
3. They contain nearly all text, with minor icons (Note: we do not need functionality within the PDF's themselves other than the user just being able to view them)

#Step 5
1. Please think about the best way to complete this objective with as minimal changes as possible. Think deeply about this so that we do not overengineer.
2. Review code written itself, and compare it with the rest of the necessary, relative folders and files to ensure compatability.
3. Test locally before agreeing the changes are good to go.
