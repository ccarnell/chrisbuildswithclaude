/*
COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT UPDATE: GEOGRAPHIC ECONOMIC INDEX TOOL

I need help implementing several updates to my web application to showcase an Anthropic Economic Index Geographic Tool. This involves:

1. Adding Product Overview Component based off the AI Safety & Ethics page that can be reusable, plus updating the Geographic Economic Index Tool with this component while keeping both pages data intact.
2. Add remaining content for Economic Index page.
3. 
4. Adjusting the Product Concept on the Economic Index page for mobile view because the text and graphics overlap the borders.

My site uses Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and motion-primitives.
*/

//PART 1: CREATE PRODUCT OVERVIEW COMPONENT
//-----------------------------------------------------
//Use the current layout of the Product Overview section on the AI Safety & Ethics page to create a new component, then replace the current code on the AI Safety & Ethics page and Economic Index page with the new component while keeping the same content for each.

/*
Location: In the middle of the AI Safety page content, after Strategic Pivot but before Project Timeline.

Content:
- Make sure each Product Overview has: Project Title (string), Purpose (string), Target (string), Key Objectives (string bulleted list), Methodologies (string bulleted list), Collaborators (string), Tripwire (string), Bookend (string)
- For the Target and Collaborators sections, ensure that whenever there is a forced wraparound for text that splits a phrase between two commas, that we instead end the line after the space of the comma before the forced break and start the new line with the beginning character of the next word. {{Example: Target for AI Safety & Ethics includes AI developers, Organizational leaders, and Policymakers. The there is a forced wraparound of the text because of screen size that would otherwise cause 'Organizational' and 'leaders' to be on two separate lines, we should instead end the first line with 'AI developers, ' go to the next line and begin with 'Organization leaders'.}}
- The bulleted lists for both Key Objectives and Methodologies could have a little bit less space between each bullet so that the lists are not so tall.
- For Bookend, 'Adverse:' should always be the first item and it should be on the first line. There should always be a 'Success:' item on a new line after the Adverse string.
- The Product Overview on the current AI Safety & Ethics page has an intentional dim on it to indicate that the project is closed out. That is not the default font color. Please keep the dim on that page, but make the component default and text on the Economic Index page the default of the rest of the text on the pages.

//PART 2: UPDATE ECONOMIC INDEX PAGE
//------------------------------------------
//Add text to Product Overview and Project Timeline

/*
Requirements:
- Product Overview > Collaborators: Research (Anthropic Economic Index team), Policy (policymaking.ai), Engineering (Claude Code), UI/UX (Claude), Strategic Product Management (Chris Carnell)
- Product Overview > Tripwire: The proposed solution was a geographical view. After mapping data to plot, gather insights on if any other visualization type may be more necessary."
- Product Overview > Bookend: "Adverse: Flourish integration is too difficult within 6-days. Input static infographic", "Success: Anthropic Economic Index Research team identifies project as valuable input for ongoing research."
- Product Timeline > Update Current Phase to Framework Design & Prototype Development
- Product Timeline > Strategic Foundation, Product Definition and Conceptualization: Add green emoji checkmark to three of the remaining four Tasks. Leave 'Begin mapping between..." without a checkmark.
- Product Timeline > Strategic Foundation, Product Definition and Conceptualization: Update Status to Complete
- Product Timeline> Framework Design and Prototype Development: Update Status to WIP
- Product Timeline > Framework Design and Prototype Development: Add the following tasks - "Download Anthropic's Economic Index data via Huggingface and review", "Gather BLS occupational codes data by GEO (determine type)", "Create JOIN for overlap of Economic Index and BLS occupational codes", "Define breakdown and/or combinations that will be mapped geographically", "Prepare data for Flourish", "Build first GEO data visualization", "Add explanatory elements to visualization", "Create Methodology and Limitations components"
- Product Timeline > Validation Framework and Final Documentation: Add the following tasks - "Finalize functional prototype display", "Finalize test criteria with internal users", "Work with GTM to plan for distribution and gathering feedback", "Set bookend for analysis", "Complete reflection of project", "Develop plans for next sprint"

// IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
// -------------------
// Please help with the following implementation tasks:

/*
1. Create Product Overview Component and update both AI Safety & Ethics and Economic Index Pages

2. Commit changes to GitHub

3. Update Economic Index Page

4. Commit changes to GitHub

Give special attention to making everything mobile-responsive. Please generate the necessary TypeScript/React components, and provide instructions on where each file should be placed in the project structure.
